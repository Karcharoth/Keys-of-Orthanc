# Keys of Orthanc

Keys of Orthanc is a variant of NarSil, itself a mostly-faithulf rewrite of Sil 1.3.0 using modern Angband code. It aims to be a smaller but more colorful version of Sil, only going down to level 10 instead of Sil's level 20, but filled with explosions, alchemists, siege weapons, secret lairs and a harrowing climb up Orthanc. It should be more challenging than making it to 500' in normal Sil, but not as challenging as making it to 1000' in normal Sil.

It is very, very incomplete.

# Contributing:
I welcome contribution! As much because it's incredibly invigorating to see someone else work on the same thing as because it saves me work and sometimes has pieces I hadn't thought of! 

Testing:
Playing Keys is useful to me, though it's very much a work in progress. I'd love to hear thoughts on balance (I'm sure some things are ridiculous, whether by rarity, uselessness, power, or just confusingness), theme (I have some doubts that all my Horrors work thematically, to tell the truth), or bugs (please generally report these as Issues on Github; collecting them all in one place helps me a lot!). Notably, it's still named NarSil in several places; that's expected, I'll get around to it someday.

Talking:
I (Karcharoth) am always up to talk about Keys, generally on the Roguelikes Discord server in the Angband channel and on issues on Github, and sometimes on Angband.live; sometimes I have questions about lore and theme, sometimes about how the NarSil code works, sometimes about whether specific in-game messages are misleading or not a problem. Sometimes other people have questions or comments, and that's the most fun of all! Obviously others testing Keys is not very useful if I don't get their feedback, but as previously mentioned, it's also invigorating!
Also, if you're having trouble compiling it, I might be able to help, and others almost certainly can.

Coding:
I'm not an expert on how to set up pull requests and so on, but if I get a pull request on Github, I'll look at it, think about it, and probably merge it in. The list of issues under either milestone on Github is a good place to start; they're both ordered roughly chronologically by when they should happen, but if someone deeply wishes to make Curses work before Keys 1.0, I have no objections! Although for Curses in particular I have some very specific ideas that I haven't documented.



# Future versions:
Keys of Orthanc 1.0 will be the minimal form - players can climb down, take Saruman's Keys, climb up, go to the base of Orthanc, unlock it, and win.

Keys of Orthanc 1.1 will have a dozen little features - a surface level that is either day or night, equippy chars, hidden treasure, simplified smithing, cannibalism, a host of stolen abilities from Sil-Q, and so on.

Keys of Orthanc 1.2 will have the important thing - Orthanc can now be climbed, Gandalf rescued, you can climb down and escape by the gate.

Keys of Orthanc 1.3-1.9 will be the big changes, one at a time - an Alchemy system, Smoke, Fire, Water, Deeps, Curses, and so on.

Keys of Orthanc 2.0 will be the biggest change of all - vaults. Customized vaults of every shape and form, everywhere, will be the biggest change for making the game feel real. Bedrooms, kitchens, machinery, workrooms, forges with half-finished weapons, and so on. For this obviously vault.txt needs to take more interesting inputs, as Frogcomposband's quests do.

....and I suppose somewhere in there I should rewrite the whole manual and tutorial, probably as Keys of Orthanc 2.1. I want an even better manual than Sil has.



# Goals:
Keys should feel quirky. Interesting, odd things should be a regular part of the game. YASD from the unexpected should not be inevitable, but it should be occasional. It should not feel like a grind.

Keys should feel logical. Room designs should feel intentional instead of completely randomly generated. Vaults should have less random monsters and more specific themes of monsters and loot. Orc bedroom on one side of the hall, wolf kennels on the other.

Keys should feel understandable. For one, the manual and commands should be easy to understand. But also, pieces of the world should feel predictable from what you already knew.

Keys should feel thematic. It should feel like it fits with the world, even more than Sil. We have less hints as to what lives in Isengard, so some stuff must be made up, but even then it should fit. For instance, artifacts in Sil are confusing - you mean to say that Morgoth has how many different artifact weapons?! How did he get those? Does this all even fit in the right time period? Everything in Keys should actually have a plausible origin.

Keys should feel epic. But not very epic - that's Sil's job. You're just rescuing Gandalf, not freeing the Silmarils from the crown of Morgoth Bauglir himself.
