# File: artefact.txt
#
# This file is used to create the 'artefact' information for Sil.
#
# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
#
#
# === Understanding artefact.txt ===
#
# name: item name
# color: attr
# object-base: tval : sval
# pval: pval
# ability: skill name : ability name

# rarity: rarity
# weight: weight
# cost: cost

# desc: text
#
# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
#     increase for each new item.
#
# 'color' is for overriding the usual object colour. (See object.txt)
#
# 'object-base' is for the object on which the artefact is based. The tval
#     is for the type of item, the sval identifies the subtype.
#
# 'pval' indicates the amount of effect the item has, if applicable.
#     (See object.txt)
#
# 'ability' is for granted abilities, represented as pairs of skill 
#     names and ability names. (See ability.txt)
#
# 'depth' is the depth the object is normally found at.
#
# 'rarity' determines how common the object is.
#
# 'weight' is in tenth-pounds.
#
# 'cost' is the item's value.
#
# 'attack' is for the item's bonus to attack and its damage dice.
#     Note that for non-weapons, adding damage dice will not
#     help with melee, only with the thrown damage.
#
# 'defence' is for the item's bonus to evasion, as well as its protection dice.
#
# 'flags' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many 
#     flags: lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags
#     and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.
#
# 'desc:' is a textual description of the artefact.
# 
# === Important Notes ===
#
# (1) The artefact indexes are defined in 'defines.h', and must not be changed.
#
# (2) Any changes or additions to the file will have influence on randarts
#     and may break savefile compatibility for old savegames with randarts.  If
#     using random artefacts, finish your existing game before making any
#     changes to the artefact.txt file at all.
#
# (3) Removing any artefact, or changing its 'base' type (as defined by
#     the tval and sval entries in the 'I:' line), will break savefile
#     compatibility for ALL savefiles.
#
# (4) Adding a new artefact, or changing the powers of existing ones, will NOT
#     affect savefile compatibility for games with the standard artefact set:
#     it is perfectly safe to do this. (If your new artefact is a new kind of
#     object, or a new one at the end of the file, you must also amend
#     object.txt or limits.txt.)
#
#
#
# === Ideas for Artefacts ===
#
# Regarding the dating and cut-offs for the items, Gandalf was imprisoned
# in July of 3018, so I'd like to keep roughly to this date.
#
# Saruman's artifacts are mostly in the following categories:
# Rohirric artifacts, mostly stolen by Wormtongue
# Dunlending artifacts, brought by them to Isengard
# Goblin artifacts, captured when he enslaved a bunch of goblins
# Forged artifacts, made by Gorol, the Great Smith
# Enchanted artifacts, made by Saruman or a lieutenant
# First/Second Age artifacts, stolen or bought with much trouble
# Perhaps a few artifacts from Mordor/Dol Guldur? Eh, but Sauron's whole deal is that right now he lies instead of giving gifts.
# 
# Of these, Dunlending artifacts should be around 300', Dunlending depth
# Goblin artifacts should be around 50' to 150', goblin depth
# Forged and Enchanted artifacts should be past 250'
# And First/Second Age artifacts should be deep, around 400'
