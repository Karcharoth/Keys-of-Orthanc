# This file defines the types of themed object drops that are used by the game.
# Most of these are just single object base types (tvals).

# 'name' is the name of the drop type.

# A 'chest' line appears if the drop type is used for themed chest contents.

# 'base' is an object base that is included in the drop type.

# 'item' is an object kind that is included in the drop type.

# 'not-base' is an object base to be excluded from the drop type.  A drop type
# with not-base definitions should not contain bases or items.
