# desc: Description
#
# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. Entry 0 is used for the player.
#
# 'plural' is for plurals to monster names that can't be handled by normal
# pluralisation rules (see mon-desc.c for more detail).
#
# 'base' is for the monster base template (see monster_base.txt). This
# provides the default display symbol, some default flags, and the monster's
# pain messages.

# 'depth' is for the depth the monster is found at.
#
# 'rarity' is their rarity (they have a 1 in rarity chance of being generated).
#
# 'glyph' is for the display symbol. If present, this overrides the default
# display symbol from the base template.
#
# 'color' is for color. There are 28 colors, as follows:
# d - 0  - Black
# w - 1  - White
# s - 2  - Slate
# o - 3  - Orange
# r - 4  - Red
# g - 5  - Green
# b - 6  - Blue
# u - 7  - Umber
# D - 8  - Light Dark
# W - 9  - Light Slate
# P - 10 - Light Purple
# y - 11 - yellow
# R - 12 - Light Red
# G - 13 - Light Green
# B - 14 - Light Blue
# U - 15 - Light Umber
# p - 16 - Purple
# v - 17 - Violet
# t - 18 - Teal
# m - 19 - Mud
# Y - 20 - Light Yellow
# i - 21 - Magenta-Pink
# T - 22 - Light Teal
# V - 23 - Light Violet
# I - 24 - Light Pink
# M - 25 - Mustard
# z - 26 - Blue Slate
# Z - 27 - Deep Light Blue

# (note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and thus the
# monster will appear to be an empty black space if its color is "d".)

#
# 'speed' is monster speed.
#
# 'health' is dice for the monster health.
#
# 'light' is light radius in squares.
#
# 'sleep' is for maximum sleep value.
#
# 'percept' is for perception score.
#
# 'stealth' is for stealth score.
#
# 'will' is for will score.
#
# 'prot' is protection - the evasion bonus and protection dice
#
# 'blows' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
#     from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
#     damage are optional.
#
# 'ranged-freq' is for ranged attack frequency. Every monster with spells must
#     have a spell-power:X line with X the percentage chance of casting each
#     turn. X must not be zero. If X is 100, the monster will never move while
#     the player is in sight, and will thus never attack in melee, as it will
#     cast spells every turn: if the monster is to use a melee attack, then X
#     must be 2 or greater.
#
# 'spell-power' determines the damage and intensity of the attacks.
#
# 'spells' is a '|'-separated list of spells.
#
# 'flags' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many flags:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags are
# separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'flags-off' is for flags to remove from the template. For example, in
# monster_base.txt, molds are given HURT_FIRE. We don't want the red mold
# to have that, so we add a 'flags-off:HURT_FIRE' line to subtract that flag.

# 'message-vis', 'message-invis', and 'message-miss' allow overriding of the
# default messages (see monster_spell.txt) displayed when a monster casts a
# particular spell.  'message-vis' is for the message when the monster is
# visible to the observer.  'message-invis' is for the message when the monster
# is not seen by the observer.  'message-miss' is for the message if the spell
# misses.  The first field, the spell type, should be one of the names listed
# on the spells line.  The last field is the message to use; if that is omitted
# or is all whitespace, no message will be displayed on casting.  Any brace
# expressions, as described in monster_spell.txt, will be expanded in the
# message before it is displayed.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed to
# describe the monster. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.

# 'drop' lines create possible drops for specific monsters.  Each item
# has its percent chance rolled for individually.  Any specified drops are in
# addition to those that are possible due to the flags set.  Specific drops
# can be affected by the DROP_GREAT and DROP_GOOD flags.

# 'drop-artifact' lines force a specific artifact to drop on death. Setting this
# on a non-UNIQUE monster is dangerous.

# 'friends' lines specify options for what monsters can appear with other
# monster on creation.  The format is:
# friends:Chance of friend appearing:number in xdy format:name of friend
#
# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
#     to describe the monster.
#
#
#
# === Understanding monster.txt flags ===
#
# UNIQUE monsters are just special monster races, with the requirement
# that only one monster of that race can exist at a time, and when it is
# killed, it can never again be generated.
#
# ATTR_CLEAR monsters appear the same color as the floor, terrain feature or
# object underneath them.
#
# ATTR_MULTI monsters are multi - hued - they change color, every player turn.
#
# CHAR_CLEAR monsters are totally invisible: the symbol shown on the screen
# is the same as the floor (or other terrain feature) below it, or the item
# that is lying on that floor. These monsters can currently be targetted as
# normal monsters: perhaps this can be changed so that the player must KNOW
# the monster is there (by bumping into it, or having the monster wake up
# and attack the player?)
#
# CHAR_MULTI monsters are those which look like objects, and use the symbols
# of objects. They are in plain sight, but the character should not know that
# a monster is there. At the moment, such monsters can be targetted normally
# (which means that this flag currently has no effect), but this may change
# in the future, as with CHAR_CLEAR monsters.
#
# (Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see... if you look
# for them, you will find them unless they are invisible and you cannot
# see invisible, and if you use the * command for targetting mode you
# can pick them as a target.)
