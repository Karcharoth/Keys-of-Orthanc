# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The '&' and '~' symbols are used
#     to include articles and pluralization as necessary to ensure
#     grammatical correctness in object descriptions.
#
# 'graphics' is for symbol and color. There are 27 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Umber
# W - Light Gray   P - Light Purple   y - Yellow        R - Light Red
# G - Light Green  B - Light Blue     U - Light Umber   p - Purple
# v - Violet       t - Teal           m - Mud           Y - Light Yellow
# i - Magenta-Pink T - Light Teal     V - Light Violet  I - Light Pink
# M - Mustard      z - Blue Slate     Z - Deep Light Blue

# Another color, "d", is used for "flavoured" items.
#
# 'type' is for the type of item (see lib/gamedata/object_base.txt).
#
# 'pval' indicates the amount of effect the item has, if applicable (a fixed
#        value: variable pvals are currently hard-coded.) 
#
# 'depth' is the depth the object is normally found at (and defines what
#     'level' the object is, when determining how easy it is to use an item).
#
# 'weight' is in tenth-pounds.
#
# 'cost' is the item's base value.
#
# 'attack' is for the item's bonus to attack and its damage dice.  Note that
#          adding damage dice to armor won't aid your attacks, it will just set
#          the damage done when it is thrown.
#
# 'defence' is for the item's bonus to evasion and its protection dice.
#
# 'alloc' is for allocation - depth and rarity, in pairs. This allows an
#     item to have multiple natural depths and rarities. It is used to
#     ensure that certain vital items such as food and identify scrolls
#     are found throughout the dungeon. The 'allocation' depth need not
#     match the depth as specified in the 'depth:' line.
#
# 'charges' is for charges (staves only).  This field accepts randomized values.
#
# 'staminapercent' is for stamina cost (staves only). When activated, the staff
#     spends that percent of your maximum stamina. Higher for fancier staves.
#
# 'effect' is for the effect when an object is eaten, activated or whatever.
# Fields are the name of the effect (as found in src/list-effects.h), the
# subtype which is either an index or a name (look at effect_subtype()
# in src/effects.c for more information about the available subtypes), the
# radius, and the other parameter.  The effect name is required.  The others
# are optional, and the trailing ones that are unused can be omitted.
#
# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.
#
# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.
#
# 'thrown-effect', 'thrown-dice' and 'thrown-expr' manage effects for thrown
# potions
#
# 'flags' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
#     lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
#     are separated by the '|' symbol.
#
# 'values' is for properties that take a value.  Valid properties are the
# object modifiers (as found in list-stats.h and list-object-modifiers.h)
# or resistances ('RES_' prepended to the element name from list-elements.h).
# The value appears in brackets after the property name.  For object modifiers,
# the value can be any random expression.  For resistances, it must be a plain
# integer value with the useful ones being 1 (resist), 3 (immune), and -1
# (vulnerable).  Like flags, values are separated by '|' and as many values:
# lines as needed can be used.
#
# 'brand' adds a brand to the object.  It should be omitted for objects
# without brands and may appear more than once for objects with multiple brands.
# Specify the brand to be added by its code in brand.txt.
#
# 'slay' adds a slay to the object.  It should be omitted for objects without
# slays and may appear more than once for objects with multiple slays.  Specify
# the slay to be added by its code in slay.txt.
#
# 'special' handles ring types where for other objects a field takes an
# integer, but for this type it takes a random value.  These fields are given
# the value 99 in this file, which is then replaced by the special calculation
# on object creation.
#
# 'msg' is any message printed on using the object.
#
# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
#     to describe the object. Note that lines will need spaces at their
#     ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
#     together.
#
# 'smithability' is for abilities that can be added to that type of artifact in smithing.
#     It has a fairly obvious syntax. Any abilities that are added will need
#     smithability: lines added (unless they can't be smithed anywhere, of course).
#     Note that most of the smithability lines are in object_base.txt - here they
#     are only for hammers and gloves right now.


##### Non-kind (contains the 'pile' picture) #####

# Index 0
name:<pile>
graphics:$:w



##### The 'Special Artifacts' #####
#
# These objects do not specify 'full names' because the artifact name
# is added in 'obj-desc.c' based on the artifact index ('i_ptr->name1').
#
# These objects do specify a 'base name, which is used when the object
# is 'aware' (always true for lites)
#
# They specify 'physical colors', which
# over-ride the 'flavor' colors, if any. 
#
# Note that ALL artifacts are given 'IGNORE_ALL',
# so we do not need to specify that here.
#
# Note that the 'INSTA_ART' flag is used to prevent these objects from
# being created without also turning them into artifacts.  This flag
# must be specified both here and in the artifact template.
#
# The 'SMITH_ART' flag indicates that this object kind should be used as
# the kind for all smithed objects that have the same type ('ring' for
# example) as this kind.
#
# The reason for having multiple 'ring' and
# 'amulet' templates is to allow each 'special artifact' to
# have a different 'color' and 'flavor', and also to allow the use of
# special 'base names' (such as 'Necklace').
